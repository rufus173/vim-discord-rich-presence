# Install

Copy the contents of the `plugin` folder to `~/.vim/plugin` (create it if it doesn't exist) and copy the contents of the `python` folder to `~/.vim/python` (it probably wont exist, so create it)

# Functionality

Note: this plugin is slow (i built it) so vim might take longer to open
when you open a new vim window, it should display the filename and file type on your discord profile. If not, make sure you have rich presence enabled on discord.

# Credits

This project would not have been possible without the help of this repository `https://github.com/vimsence/vimsence/tree/master` for guidance on how discords IPC works. Lots of code snippets are lifted from this project.
